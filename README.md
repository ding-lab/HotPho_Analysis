# HotPho: Spatially Interacting Phosphorylation Sites and Mutations in Cancer #

## Analysis for co-clustering mutations and phosphosites## 
>The project analyzes HotPho outputs and investigates co-clustering somatic mutations and phosphosites. This directory contain the analyses scripts.  
> HotSpot3D/Data_201807/worklog documents the latest-used commands to run HotPho on PTMcosmos phosphosites and TCGA MC3 mutations. 
> Analyses contains multiple scripts used to analyze HotPho results.
